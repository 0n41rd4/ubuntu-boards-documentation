=======================
SiFive HiFive Unmatched
=======================

The `SiFive HiFive Unmatched`_ is a RISC-V based :term:`SBC`.

Using the pre-installed server image
====================================

#. Flash the pre-installed server image to a microSD card (see
   :doc:`/how-to/flash-images`)

#. Insert the microSD card into the board

#. Set the boot source to the microSD card (see `Boot source selection`_)

#. Connect to the :term:`UART` USB port using a micro USB cable
   (see `UART console`_ and :doc:`/how-to/uart-console`)

#. Power on the board

#. Wait for an output line confirming that `cloud-init`_ has finished running;
   this service is responsible for generating SSH keys, and creating the
   default user:

   .. code-block:: text

       [   35.682018] cloud-init[909]: Cloud-init v. 24.1.3-0ubuntu3 finished at Tue, 23 Apr 2024 07:44:59 +0000. Datasource DataSourceNoCloud [seed=/var/lib/cloud/seed/nocloud-net][dsmode=net].  Up 35.65 seconds

#. Login with the user *ubuntu* and the default password *ubuntu*; you will be
   asked to choose a new password


Using the live server image
===========================

The live installer image is used to install Ubuntu to an :term:`NVMe` drive
attached to the M.2 slot on the board.

#. Flash the pre-installed server image to a microSD card (see
   :doc:`/how-to/flash-images`)

#. Insert the microSD card into the board

#. Set the boot source to the microSD card (see `Boot source selection`_)

#. Connect to the :term:`UART` USB port using a micro USB cable
   (see `UART console`_ and :doc:`/how-to/uart-console`)

#. Power on the board; if there is no operating system already on the NVMe
   drive, skip to step 8

#. When "Hit any key to stop autoboot" is displayed, press :kbd:`Enter`

#. Enter the following commands to boot the installer:

   .. code-block:: text

       pci enum
       nvme scan
       load mmc 0:1 $fdt_addr_r dtb/sifive/hifive-unmatched-a00.dtb
       load mmc 0:1 $kernel_addr_r EFI/boot/bootriscv64.efi
       bootefi $kernel_addr_r $fdt_addr_r

#. From the GRUB menu, select "Try or Install Ubuntu Server"

#. Loading the installer takes some time. Once it is loaded, follow the
   `Ubuntu Server installation tutorial
   <https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-server>`_

#. Once the installation is complete, reboot the board without removing the
   microSD card

#. Press :kbd:`Enter` when "Hit any key to stop autoboot" is displayed, and
   enter:

   .. code-block:: text

       pci enum
       nvme scan
       efidebug boot add -b 0001 'Ubuntu' nvme 0:1 /EFI/ubuntu/grubriscv64.efi
       efidebug boot order 0001
       bootefi bootmgr

#. On the next boot, U-Boot will automatically start GRUB

.. note::

    U-Boot does not allow the operating system to write :term:`UEFI` variables.
    You can do this manually using U-Boot's :command:`eficonfig` command.


Boot source selection
=====================

The SiFive HiFive Unmatched board can boot firmware from the built-in flash
memory, or from the microSD card. The boot source is selected via DIP switches.

=====  =====  =====  =====  ==============================
MSEL3  MSEL2  MSEL1  MSEL0  Boot Source
=====  =====  =====  =====  ==============================
0      1      0      1      QSPI0 Flash
0      1      1      0      QSPI0 Flash
0      1      1      1      QSPI1 Flash
1      0      0      0      QSPI1 microSD Card
1      0      0      1      QSPI2 Flash
1      0      1      0      QSPI0 Flash
1      0      1      1      QSPI2 microSD Card (*default*)
1      1      0      0      QSPI1 Flash
1      1      0      1      QSPI1 Flash
1      1      1      0      QSPI0 Flash
1      1      1      1      QSPI0 Flash
=====  =====  =====  =====  ==============================

On Ubuntu, the only supported setting is the default QSPI2 microSD card
setting of 1011 as illustrated below:

.. image:: /images/unmatched-boot-source-sd.jpg
    :width: 15em
    :alt: Boot from microSD card with the default setting of 1011

.. warning::

    On version 2 of the HiFive Unmatched boards, the silk screen showing the
    orientation of the MSEL DIP switches is incorrect and should be ignored
    (follow the settings on the image above). The suffix of the board assembly
    number label indicates the board version, e.g. the 2 in HF105-ASSY-2A0
    indicates board version 2.


UART console
============

The board makes both :term:`JTAG` and :term:`UART` available over the micro USB
connector located adjacent to the microSD card slot. When connected, it appears
as two separate devices in Linux (:file:`/dev/ttyUSB0`, :file:`/dev/ttyUSB1`).
The second ttyUSB device represents the UART.

For U-Boot and Linux, connect with:

* 115200 baud
* 8 data bits
* no parity
* 1 stop bit
* no flow control

However, for the boot ROM, the baud rate should be adjusted to 57600. For
example, to access the UART for the U-Boot prompt:

.. code-block:: text

    screen /dev/ttyUSB1 115200,cs8,-parenb,-cstopb
