Install Ubuntu on the Microchip PIC64GX1000 Curiosity Kit
=========================================================

The first stage boot loader of the PIC64GX Curiosity Kit is called `Hart Software Services <https://github.com/pic64gx/pic64gx-hart-software-services>`_ (HSS). Ubuntu requires version v2024.06 or later of this software. The HSS sources are available on `GitHub <https://github.com/pic64gx/pic64gx-hart-software-services>`_ and can be built and programmed using the linked `instructions <https://github.com/pic64gx/pic64gx-hart-software-services/blob/pic64gx/README.md>`_.


Supported images
================

* Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble Numbat) pre-installed server:
