    API
        An `Application Programming Interface
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API>`_

    EBBR
        The `Embedded Base Boot Requirements
        <https://arm-software.github.io/ebbr/index.html>`_ specification.

    eMMC
        `Embedded MultiMediaCard
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MultiMediaCard#eMMC>`_, a storage
        standard that puts the components of a MultiMediaCard in an integrated
        circuit for use in circuit boards as non-volatile storage.

    GPIO
        General Purpose Input/Output; in the context of :term:`SBCs <SBC>`,
        this typically refers to the prominent pin-header (often containing
        2Ã—20 pins) along one edge of the board. Some (but not all) of these
        pins may be controlled by software, operating as inputs or outputs.

    GRUB
        The GNU `GRand Unified Bootloader
        <https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/>`_, commonly used as the Linux
        bootloader on PC platforms, and a few :term:`SBCs <SBC>` too.

    QEMU
        The `Quick Emulator <https://www.qemu.org/>`_ project, a popular
        virtual machine implementation supporting multiple architectures and
        cross-architectural emulation under Linux/BSD.

    SBC
        A Single Board Computer.

    TTL
        `Transistor-transistor logic
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor%E2%80%93transistor_logic>`_;
        a family of logic circuits. In the context of serial adapters and
        :term:`UART` consoles, however, this usually refers to the voltage
        level expected.

        The `RS-232 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-232>`_ standard (commonly
        used in serial interfaces) permits a wide range of voltages from 3V up
        to 15V. However, the UARTs on most :term:`SBCs <SBC>` expect no more
        than the 3.3V typically used on their :term:`GPIO` headers. Thus, "TTL
        UART" or "serial TTL" implies a UART interface (or adapter) that
        requires (or accepts) no more than 3.3V through its pins.

    UART
        `Universal Asynchronous receiver-transmitter
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter>`_;
        the acronym most commonly used to reference a device's `serial port
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port>`_ over which a Linux
        console may be accessed.

        Frequently used for debugging early boot problems, as the serial port
        is a much simpler device than video output, and thus less likely to
        fail in the event of kernel bugs.

    UEFI
        `Unified Extensible Firmware Interface
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFI>`_ is a specification for the
        booting of computer hardware. Whilst nearly ubiquitous on modern PCs,
        support for it is considerably more sparse on :term:`SBCs <SBC>`.
