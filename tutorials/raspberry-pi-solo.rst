=======================================
Install Ubuntu on Raspberry Pi directly
=======================================

This tutorial will guide you through installing Ubuntu on your Raspberry Pi
without the need for an additional machine. You will need the following:

* A Raspberry Pi Model 4B or later

* Storage media; one of:

  - microSD card sized 16GB or larger

  - SSD drive with an appropriate USB3 adapter

  - NVMe drive with an appropriate HAT (Pi 5 only)

* A monitor

* A keyboard

* A mouse

* An ethernet based internet connection

.. note::

    This procedure will *not* operate over wifi as the bootloader cannot
    configure wifi at this time.
